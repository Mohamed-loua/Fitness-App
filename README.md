# Fitness-App
This is first fitness app project. This app takes your weight, height, and age to calculate customized macronutrient goals for weight gain or loss. The app will create meals plans based on your informations. I hope this app becomes your most used tool on your weight loss or weight gain journey.

In the Frontend directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
